## Datasets Available in R

> *Note:* To search for R datasets please download (or clone) this github repository and open the *WhatData.html* file in your browser.

### Motivation & Objective

There *are* many useful datasets available for you to use in Base R and the packages that 
are installed on your system. Sometimes I need to find an R datasets of a particular class 
(e.g. `tbl_df`, `data.frame`, `ts`) which I would like to use for: 

* teaching
* presentations 
* preparing reproducible example code (see [`reprex`](https://github.com/tidyverse/reprex) package)

This program creates a `tibble` call `all_ds` that makes it easier to search for datasets 
based on the keywords and/or classes.
