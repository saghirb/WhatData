## Datasets Available in R

> *Note:* To search for R datasets please download (or clone) this github repository and open the *WhatData.html* file in your browser.

### Motivation & Objective

There *are* many useful datasets available in Base R and the packages that are installed on 
your system. Sometimes you might need to find an R datasets of a particular class  (e.g. `tbl_df`,
`data.frame`, `ts`) that you can use for: 

* teaching,
* a presentation or
* preparing reproducible example code (see [`reprex`](https://github.com/tidyverse/reprex) 
package).

Based on the packages that are installed [WhatData](https://github.com/saghirb/WhatData) creates 
a `data.frame` (called `all_ds`) of datasets which can be searched using keywords and/or classes.
